# race-track-game

Hello this is the internship assignment for Vyorius

In this game I have created a track and some cars.

Player can drive a car and move around in the track with arrow keys for left, right forward and backward movement.

In this I have used rigidbody component for cars for physics and box collider for detecting collisions with surroundigs. I have used Wheel Collider components for all the wheels of cars. 

Through wheel colliders we can give Torque to the wheel object using motorTorque property and move the car in forward and backward directions.

With wheel collider's steerAngle property we can give the steering direction to control the vehicle.
